&nbsp; <br>
Solution to 12.1.14: Answer is floor of (n+1)/2: <br>
&nbsp; <br>
* First note that each spanning tree of K_{2,n} has degrees (a,b) on one
side and (1,1,...,1,2) on the other side, <br>
 where in the first list a+b=n+1 (with a, b positive integers), and <br>
 the second list has (n-1) 1's
and one 2 -- if there are two 2's on the second list, there will be a cycle.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
* Now easy to see that the number of unordered choices for (a,b) is the floor of (n+1)/2, <br>
namely, (1,n), (2,n-1), ..., (floor{n+1/2}, ceil{n+1/2})  <br>
