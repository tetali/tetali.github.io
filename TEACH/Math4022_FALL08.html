Show that every collection containing less than <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2^{n-1} sets (each being an n-set) has Property B.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (Hint: use a random 2-coloring.)<br><br>
(*) Sorry for the typo: the RANGE should be THREE MILES rather than 6 miles; everything else is good. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use Application 5.2.11 in the book to solve this.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The problem is adapted (as acknowledged in the textbook) from Bondy-Murty,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the city has RADIUS 6 MILES and a range of NINE MILES for each transmitting<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; station.<br><br>&nbsp;*** FINAL EXAM on Wednesday, Dec. 10th, 11:30am -- 2:20pm (Room 246)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Syllabus: Chapters 1-- 5 of Doug West's book. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OPEN TEXT BOOK ***<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
